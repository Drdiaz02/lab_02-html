## First Webpage

This project was very frustrating at first, but Iâ€™ve learned that the things which frustrate you the most 
often feel far more rewarding once you figure them out.

I experimented with links and lists to see how they would look when deployed. 
At one point I used a list for the navigation links, but I decided it felt more like a real website 
when the links were displayed horizontally.

This project was also my first time deploying a site through GitHub Pages, and it was exciting 
to see the page live and working online.
